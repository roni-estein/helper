## About Livewire Helper

Livewire helper is a simple base project that you can use to ask question of people in both the [Livewire Discord Help Channel](https://discord.gg/AWZt3P), and to create issues in the [Livewire repository](https://github.com/livewire/livewire) that are too complex for [Laravel Playground](https://laravelplayground.com/#/)

### Sections

Steps are broken down into sections that are tagged, so you can jump to a specific place in the installation process if you need to make any changes. I'll list the steps we've made to produce this helper project in case you want to do this on your own.

### 1. Git Init

The first step you should do in any project, you should always start off by making a git repository so that you can roll back and undo

Navigate to the helper directory and run the command

```
git init
```
